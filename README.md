## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, you must create a application to practice what you have learned in React Native!

This will be an application to consume data from the repositories of your portfolio using the application of Node.js that was created at [challenge 02](https://github.com/antoniowd/gostack-challenge-02). 

### Application requirements

- **List the repositories of your API**: You should be able to create a list of all the repositories that are registered in your API with the title fields, techs and number of tastes following the ${repository.likes} tastes pattern, just changing the number to be dynamic.

- **Like a repository listed in the API**: You must be able to like an item in your API via a button with the *Curtir* text and must update the number of likes in the listings on mobile.
